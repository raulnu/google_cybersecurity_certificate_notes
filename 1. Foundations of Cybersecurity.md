## 1.1	Key Words

- **Compliance** is the process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines and security breaches.
- **Security frameworks** are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy.
- **Security posture** is an organization’s ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change. A strong security posture leads to lower risk for the organization.

# 2	The evolution of cybersecurity

## 2.1	Phishing

**Phishing** is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software. 

Some of the most common types of phishing attacks today include:

- **Business Email Compromise (BEC):** A threat actor sends an email message that seems to be from a known source to make a seemingly legitimate request for information, in order to obtain a financial advantage.
- **Spear phishing:** A malicious email attack that targets a specific user or group of users. The email seems to originate from a trusted source.
- **Whaling:** A form of spear phishing. Threat actors target company executives to gain access to sensitive data.
- **Vishing:** The exploitation of electronic voice communication to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.
- **Smishing:** The use of text messages to trick users, in order to obtain sensitive information or to impersonate a known source.

## 2.2	Malware

**Malware** is software designed to harm devices or networks.

Some of the most common types of malware attacks today include:

- **Viruses:** Malicious code written to interfere with computer operations and cause damage to data and software. A virus needs to be initiated by a user (i.e., a threat actor), who transmits the virus via a malicious attachment or file download. When someone opens the malicious attachment or download, the virus hides itself in other files in the now infected system. When the infected files are opened, it allows the virus to insert its own code to damage and/or destroy data in the system.
- **Worms:** Malware that can duplicate and spread itself across systems on its own. In contrast to a virus, a worm does not need to be downloaded by a user. Instead, it self-replicates and spreads from an already infected computer to other devices on the same network.
- **Ransomware:** A malicious attack where threat actors encrypt an organization's data and demand payment to restore access.
- **Spyware:** Malware that’s used to gather and sell information without consent. Spyware can be used to access devices. This allows threat actors to collect personal data, such as private emails, texts, voice and image recordings, and locations.

### 2.2.1	**3 malware examples**

- Brain virus: 1986, Alvi brothers, accidentally infected disks too.
- Morris worm: Meant to install on all PCs to count, but accidentally
reinstalled infinitely until ran out of memory. Led to creation of CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams).
- LoveLetter (aka "I Love You"), already known. Sent to all email
contacts & collected passwords. Example of social engineering.

## 2.3	What to do during a breach?

- Keep cool
- Be the "pause" in a conversation
- STOP the breach, then investigate it

## 2.4	Social Engineering

**Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.

Some of the most common types of social engineering attacks today include:

- **Social media phishing:** A threat actor collects detailed information about their target from social media sites. Then, they initiate an attack.
- **Watering hole attack:** A threat actor attacks a website frequently visited by a specific group of users.
- **USB baiting:** A threat actor strategically leaves a malware USB stick for an employee to find and install, to unknowingly infect a network.
- **Physical social engineering:** A threat actor impersonates an employee, customer, or vendor to obtain unauthorized access to a physical location.

Reasons why social engineering attacks are effective include:

- **Authority:** Threat actors impersonate individuals with power. This is because people, in general, have been conditioned to respect and follow authority figures.
- **Intimidation:** Threat actors use bullying tactics. This includes persuading and intimidating victims into doing what they’re told.
- **Consensus/Social proof:** Because people sometimes do things that they believe many others are doing, threat actors use others’ trust to pretend they are legitimate. For example, a threat actor might try to gain access to private data by telling an employee that other people at the company have given them access to that data in the past.
- **Scarcity:** A tactic used to imply that goods or services are in limited supply.
- **Familiarity:** Threat actors establish a fake emotional connection with users that can be exploited.
- **Trust:** Threat actors establish an emotional relationship with users that can be exploited *over time*. They use this relationship to develop trust and gain personal information.
- **Urgency:** A threat actor persuades others to respond quickly and without questioning.

# 3	Protect against threats, risks, and vulnerabilities

Topics: Frameworks, controls and ethics

Situation

You work as a security analyst, and receive multiple alerts about suspicious activity. To avoid this alerts becoming serious incidents, we need to:

1. Identify critical assets and risks
2. Implement frameworks and controls

## 3.1	Frameworks and Controls

### 3.1.1	Purpose of security Frameworks

- Protecting PII
- Securing financial information
- Identifying security weaknesses
- Managing organisational risks
- Aligning security with business goals

### 3.1.2	Core components of Frameworks

1. **Goals:** identifying and documenting security goals
2. **Guidelines:** set to achieve security goals
3. **Processes:** implement
4. **Communication:** monitor and communicate results

Example: adjust to GDPR for data protection

1. Identify and document areas where the organisation is out of compliance with GDPR
2. Develop new policies that adjust to GDPR
3. Implement the policies developed in the previous step
4. Monitor changes and communicate results

### 3.1.3	Controls

Safeguards designed to reduce specific risks

Example: Employee training in Data Privacy to reduce risk of data breach

### 3.1.4	CIA Triad

- Confidentiality: only authorised users should access specific assets or data
    - Application example: Access Controls
- Integrity: Data is correct, authentic, and reliable
    - Application example: Encryption to evade modification
- Availability: Data is accessible to those who are authorised to access it

### 3.1.5	NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

A voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk

Functions:

- **Govern:** Establishing and maintaining the structures and processes needed to effectively manage CS risk.
    - Setting clear CS objectives, developing and implementing risk management strategy, etc
- **Identify:** Management of CS risk and its effects
- **Protect:** Strategy used to protect and organization through implementation of policies, procedures, training, etc.
- **Detect:** Improving monitoring capabilities
- **Respond:** Procedures to contain, neutralize and analyze security incidents, and improving the process
- **Recover:** Return to normal operation

### 3.1.6	Asset

An item perceived as having value to an organisation

### 3.1.7	Compliance

Process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations

## 3.2	Ethics

As a cybersecurity professional, we must remain unbiased and maintain security and confidentiality

### 3.2.1	Ethical principles in security

- Confidentiality
    - Keep PII that we work with safe
    - Don’t access information that we don’t need to
- Privacy protections
    - Safeguarding personal information from unauthorised use
- Laws

## 3.3	International standpoint on counterattacks

The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if:

- The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
- The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
- The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
- The counterattack effects can be reversed.

Organizations typically do not counterattack because the above scenarios and parameters are hard to measure. There is a lot of uncertainty dictating what is and is not lawful, and at times negative outcomes are very difficult to control. Counterattack actions generally lead to a worse outcome, especially when you are not an experienced professional in the field.

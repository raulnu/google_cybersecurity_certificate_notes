# 1	Security Domains

## 1.1	Security Posture

An organisation’s ability to manage its defense or critical assets and data, and react to change

## 1.2	Threat, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### 1.2.1	Threat

A threat is any circumstance or event that can negatively impact assets

### 1.2.2	Risks

A risk is anything that can impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an asset

- Low risks: public information → wouldn’t harm the organization
- Medium risks: non public information → would harm the organization
- High risks → protected information → would harm the organization a lot

In order to be a risks, there must be a threat and a vulnerability

### 1.2.3	Risk Managing Strategies:

- **Acceptance**: Accepting a risk to avoid disrupting business continuity
- **Avoidance**: Creating a plan to avoid the risk altogether
- **Transference**: Transferring risk to a third party to manage
- **Mitigation**: Lessening the impact of a known risk

### 1.2.4	Vulnerability

Weakness that can be exploited by a threat

Examples:

- **ProxyLogon:** A pre-authenticated vulnerability that affects the Microsoft Exchange server. This means a threat actor can complete a user authentication process to deploy malicious code from a remote location.
- **ZeroLogon:** A vulnerability in Microsoft’s Netlogon authentication protocol. An authentication protocol is a way to verify a person's identity. Netlogon is a service that ensures a user’s identity before allowing access to a website's location.
- **Log4Shell:** Allows attackers to run Java code on someone else’s computer or leak sensitive information. It does this by enabling a remote attacker to take control of devices connected to the internet and run malicious code.
- **PetitPotam:** Affects Windows New Technology Local Area Network (LAN) Manager (NTLM). It is a theft technique that allows a LAN-based attacker to initiate an authentication request.
- **Security logging and monitoring failures:** Insufficient logging and monitoring capabilities that result in attackers exploiting vulnerabilities without the organization knowing it
- **Server-side request forgery:** Allows attackers to manipulate a server-side application into accessing and updating backend resources. It can also allow threat actors to steal data.
## 1.3	Key Impacts

### 1.3.1	Financial impact

- Interrupted services
- Cost to correct issues
- Fines for compromised assets because of non-compliance

### 1.3.2	Identity Theft

Sensitive data storage have that risk

### 1.3.3	Reputation

Organization’s damaged reputation due to exploited vulnerabilities, client loss, fines, etc.

## 1.4	National Institut of Standards ant Technology (NIST) Risk Management Framework (RMF)

Used to mitigate and manage risks

7 steps:

- **Prepare**:
    - Manage security and privacy risks before a breach occurs
    - Entry-level: Monitor risks and reduce them
- **Categorize:**
    - Developing risk management processes and tasks
    - Entry-level: Understand the processes established by my organization
- **Select:**
    - Choose, customize, and capture documentation of the controls that protect an organization
    - Keeping a playbook up to date
- **Implement:**
    - Implement security and privacy plans for the organization
- **Assess:**
    - Determine if established controls are implemented correctly
- **Authorize:**
    - Being accountable for the security and privacy risks that may exist in an organization
- **Monitor:**
    - Being aware of how systems are operating

# 2	Security Frameworks and Controls


## 2.1	Frameworks and Controls

### 2.1.1	Frameworks

Guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risk and threats to data and privacy

They provide how to prevent, detect and respond

Examples:

- Cyber Threat Framework
- ISO 27001

### 2.1.2	Controls

Used to reduce specific risks. They act towards a more direct threats and vulnerabilities.

Examples:

- **Encryption**: using ciphertext instead of plain text
- **Authentication**: login with password, multifactor authentication (MFA), biometrics, etc
    - Vishing is a social engineering attack that points to a biometric vulnerability
- **Authorization:** access controls, permissions, gates and fences (physical), etc

## 2.2	CIA Triad

Model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies

## 2.3	[NIST Framework Functions](https://www.notion.so/1-Foundations-of-Cybersecurity-248688b14a4180cfa260c83d54e9f713?pvs=21)

## 2.4	OWASP Principles and Security Audits

Open Web Application Security Project

Principles:

- **Minimize attack surface area**: reduce unneeded features, etc
- **Principle of least privilege**: users must have minimal needed privileges
- **Defense in depth:** an organization should have multiple security controls, like firewalls, MFA, etc
- **Separation of duties:** nobody shouldn’t have permissions to do everything
- **Keep security simple:** avoid unnecessary complex solutions
- **Fix security issues correctly**

Extra principles: Establish secure defaults, Fail securely, Don’t trust services, Avoid security by obscurity.

## 2.5	Security Audits

Review of an oganization’s security controls, policies, and procedures against a set of expectations

It can be _internal_ or _external_

Internal audit:

- Objectives
    - Identify organizational risk
    - Assess controls
    - Correct compliance issues
- Common elements
    - Establishing the scope and goals of the audit
    - Conducting a risk assessment
    - Completing a controls assessment
    - Assessing compliance
    - Communicating results
- Helpful questions

Autid checklist:

- **Identify the scope of the audit**
- **Complete a risk assessment**
- **Conduct the audit**
- **Create a mitigation plan**
- **Communicate results to stakeholders**

# 1	Introduction to Operating Systems
## 1.1	The world of operating systems
### 1.1.1	Windows and macOS
Windows and macOS are both common operating systems. The Windows operating system was introduced in 1985, and macOS was introduced in 1984. Both operating systems are used in personal and enterprise computers. 

Windows is a closed-source operating system, which means the source code is not shared freely with the public. macOS is partially open source. It has some open-source components, such as macOS’s kernel. macOS also has some closed-source components.
### 1.1.2	Linux
The first version of Linux was released in 1991, and other major releases followed in the early 1990s. Linux is a completely open-source operating system, which means that anyone can access Linux and its source code. The open-source nature of Linux allows developers in the Linux community to collaborate.

Linux is particularly important to the security industry. There are some distributions that are specifically designed for security. Later in this course, you’ll learn about Linux and its importance to the security industry.
### 1.1.3	ChromeOS
ChromeOS launched in 2011. It’s partially open source and is derived from Chromium OS, which is completely open source. ChromeOS is frequently used in the education field.
### 1.1.4	Android and iOS
Android and iOS are both mobile operating systems. Unlike the other operating systems mentioned, mobile operating systems are typically used in mobile devices, such as phones, tablets, and watches. Android was introduced for public use in 2008, and iOS was introduced in 2007. Android is open source, and iOS is partially open source.
## 1.2	The operating system at work
### 1.2.1	Turning on the computer
- Interact with the hardware, more precisely the *power button*
- This *boots* the computer, bringing up the *operating system*
	- Booting the computer means that a microchip called *BIOS is activated*
	- This chip has lately been replaced by *UEFI*
	- Both *BIOS and UEFI* contain booting instructions to *load the "bootloader"*
	- Then, the *bootloader* *starts* the *operating system*
### 1.2.2	Using an application
- User interacts with an application
- The application communicates with the operating system
- The operating system interpretes the request and directs it to the appropriate hardware component
- Then the process is reverted
### 1.2.3	Resource allocation
The OS manages the resources and memory available to complete the tasks demanded by the applications.
## 1.3	The user interface
The user interface is a program that allows the user to control the functions of the operating system.
We basically have 2 types:
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** A user interface that uses icons on the screen to manage different tasks
	- Easier but less customizable tasks
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** Text-based user interface with text commands to interact with the computer
	- Harder but more customizable tasks
# 2	The Linux Operating System
## 2.1	Linux
Open-source operating system.
### 2.1.1	Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)
The component of Linux that organizes data
### 2.1.2	Kernel
Component of Linux that manages processes and memory
### 2.1.3	Packet managers
A package is a piece of software that can be combined with other packages to form an application. They are managed with *package managers*.
There are many package managers:
- Debian-based use dpkg or Advanced Package Took (APT)
- Red Hat-based use Red Hat Package Manager (RPM) or Yellowdog Updater Modified (YUM)
## 2.2	Linux distributions
Linux distributions use the same kernel, but they modify the GUI, pre-installed programs, and especializations.
### 2.2.1	Parent distributions
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux -> CentOS
- Slackware -> SUSE
- Debian -> Ubuntu and KALI
### 2.2.2	KALI Linux
Made for penetration testing and digital forensics.
Best use on a VM.
Tools for **pentesting**:
- Metasploit
- Burp suite
- John the ripper
- etc
Tools for **digital forensics**:
- tcpdump
- wireshark
- Autopsy
### 2.2.3	Other distros
- Ubuntu
- Parrot: Also basen on debian and used for pentesting and digital forensics
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux -> subscription based
- AlmaLinux -> CentOS "replacement"
## 2.3	The shell
Is the command line interpreter. 
There are many different types of **shells**:
- Bourne-Again Shell (bash)
- C Shell (csh)
- Korn Shell (ksh)
- Enhanced C Shell (tcsh)
- Z Shell (zsh)
- etc
But the bash shell is the most commonly used shell in the cybersecurity profession.

The user inserts an input, and the shell returns an output. The output is a standard output or a standard error.
# 3	Linux Commands in the Bash Shell
## 3.1	Navigate the Linux file system
Commands:
- pwd
- ls
- cd
- cat
- head (cat the first 10 lines)
- tail (cat the last 10 lines)
- less: read files page by page
	- space: move forward one page
	- b: move back one page
	- down and up arrow: move lines
	- q: quit
### 3.1.1	Standard FHS
- /**home**
- /**bin**: binary files and other executables
- /**etc**: system configuration files
- /**tmp**: temporary files. All users can use this directory
- /**mnt**: "mount", stores media like USB drives,and hard drives
## 3.2	Manage file content in Bash
### 3.2.1	Find what you need
- **grep**: look for text in files, or in standard outputs adding a pipeline
	- files: grep raul users.txt
	- standard outputs: ls /home | grep raul
- **find**: you can search for files and directories that
	- Contain a specific string in the name
		- find /home -name ".txt"
		- user -iname for case insensitive
	- Are a certain file size
	- Were last modified within a certain time frame.
		- find /home -mtime -3 (all files and directories modified in the last 3 days)
		- find /home -mtime +3 (all files and directories modified more than 3 days ago)
### 3.2.2	Create and modify directories and files
- mkdir
- rmdir
- touch
- rm
- cp
- mv
- nano
## 3.3	Authenticate and authorize users
**Permissions:** The type of access granted for a file or directory. *Related to Authorization*
**Authorization:** The concept of granting access to specific resources in a system.
### 3.3.1	Types of permissions
- Read
- Write
- Execute
This permissions are granted to different types of owners.
### 3.3.2	Types of owners
- Users -> owner of the file. It can be changed
- Group -> groups are groups of users
- Other -> all other users on the system
### 3.3.3	Changing permissions
Command "chmod"
```
chmod g+w, o-r access.txt
```
- user: u
- group: g
- other: o
### 3.3.4	Add and delete users
**Root user**: or superuser, is a user with elevated privileges to modify the system
> only root users can create new users

Problems with logging as root:
- Security risk
- Irreversible mistakes
- Accountability (no one is going to know who did what)

To solve this: *sudo*

**Create user:** useradd
```
sudo useradd newuser
```

**Delete user**: userdel

**Modify user:** usermod
```
sudo usermod -g newgroup oldgroup // change primary group from old to new
sudo usermod -a -G newgroup raulnu // add raulnu to newgroup  
```
- -d: Changes the user’s home directory.
- -l: Changes the user’s login name.
- -L: Locks the account so the user can’t log in.

**Change ownership:** chown
```
sudo chown raulnu access.txt // making raulnu owner of access.txt
```
## 3.4	Get help in Linux
- Looking for resources online
- man pages within the shell
- whatis
- apropos: look for commands that contain what we are looking:
	- apropos password
	- appropos -a change password
- Linux resources
# 4	Databases and SQL
## 4.1	Introduction to SQL and Databases
**Database:** An organized collection of information or data
Like a spreadsheet, but made to:
- Be used by many people at the same time
- Be able to store a large amount of data
- Tolerate complex functions to access the data

**Relational database:** A structured database containing tables that are related to each other
- We can connect two tables if they **share a common column**
- Columns that connect two tables are called **keys**
### 4.1.1	Keys
- **Primary key:** A column where every row has a unique entry. It cannot be duplicate, it has to be unique.
- **Foreign key**: A column in a table that is a primary key in another table
### 4.1.2	Structured Query Language (SQL)
A programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
**Query:** A request for data from a database table or a combination of tables

Use examples: 
- Query logs looking for unusual patterns
- Check which machines haven't been updated
## 4.2	SQL Queries
- SELECT columns / *
- FROM table
- ORDER BY
### 4.2.1	Filtering
- WHERE
	- column = 'value' 
	- *column LIKE 'Word%'* -> all values that start with 'Word'
## 4.3	More SQL Filters
### 4.3.1	Common Data types
- String
- Numeric
- Date and time
- Boolean
### 4.3.2	4.3.2 Time, dates and numbers operators
- =
- >
- <
- <> (not equal to)
- >=
- <=
- BETWEEN 'value' AND 'value' (values included)
### 4.3.3	AND, OR, and NOT
- **AND** -> add condition
- **OR** -> include another possible condition
- **NOT** -> negates or excludes a condition
## 4.4	SQL Joins
### 4.4.1	INNER JOIN
Returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table
Example:
```
SELECT username, office, operating_system   // Select these columns 
											// (some are from 'employees', others from 'machines')
FROM employees // from this table
INNER JOIN machines ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee.id // and add the columns from 
																	// 'machines' table that match
																	// the employee_id
```
### 4.4.2	Outer joins
- **LEFT JOIN**
	- Returns all records of the first table, but only rows (records) of the second table that match on a specified column
- **RIGHT JOIN**
	- All records of the second table, but only rows (records) of the first table that match on a specified column
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**
	- Returns all records from both tables
	- Nonexistent values will be shown as NULL

Example: 
```
SELECT *
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN machines ON employees.device_id = machines.device_id;
```
### 4.4.3	Additional functions
- **COUNT**
- **AVG**
- **SUM**
